    <h1> Mozart as a middle-aged man was remarkable in his sad demeanor and funcky smell</h1>
      <p>At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled 
in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. 
He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, 
he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely 
unfinished at the time of his death. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized. He was survived 
by his wife Constanze and two sons.</p>

    <p>He composed more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, 
and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent 
Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote that 
"posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"</p>
